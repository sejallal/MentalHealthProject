    factors both expected and unexpected that students experience through academics, extracurriculars or social
    situations. In order to reduce this in your life, find people you can trust and talk to about how
    you are feeling. Writing down your thoughts in a journal is highly recommended as well. Stress relievers such as
    singing, dancing, reading, etc. can help distract you from that stress or help you express it. Finally, using the
    resources on/off campus as well as many organizations that offer apps and assistance when it comes to anxiety such as

  <button class="accordion"><h2>Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD)</h2></button>
  <div class = "panel">
  <div class = "box">
    <div class= "disorderhead">
      <p>OCD is a common long-lasting disorder where a person has uncontrollable reoccuring thoughts (obsessions) and behaviors (compulsions) that one feels
    the urge to repeat over and over. These obsessions or compulsions can interfere with all aspects of life (work, school, relationships). Ones thoughts
    and actions are beyond their control. About 1/40 adults in the US has OCD. </p>
    <h2>Symptoms</h2>
    <p>Obsessive thoughts can include: Fear of germs, Needing things to be symmetrical and orderly, worries about hurting others or being hurt,
      Constant awareness of blinking, breathing or other body sensations, Unwanted thoughts (agression or sexual or religious subjects).</p>
    <p>Compulsive thoughts can include: Washing hands many times in a row, Performing tasks in a specific order, Need to count things (steps, pencils),
      Putting items in a exact order, Repetitive checking (light switch, door lock), Demanding reassurance, Fear of using public toilets, shaking hands.</p>
  </div>
     <img src="images/ocd.jpg" alt = "OCD" class="image"/>
  </div>
  <h2>What you should do if you notice signs of OCD in you or a friend</h2>
  <p>The standard treatment for OCD is Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT), a type of psychotherapy. Recognizing your obsessions and compulsions and how and linking it to anxiety is
    very important so you know what is causing you to be uncomfortable and anxious. A type of CBT theory, Exposure and Response Prevention (ERB) is where you confront your fears (touching a door handle,
    dirt) without reasurring yourself or putting yourself in compulsive behavior situations (washing hands right away) so you learn healthy ways to cope with your anxiety.
    This way you are slowly learning how to resist your compulsions and obsessions so your anxiety will learn to fade. Medications and therapy are also a treatment option. Antidepressants are usually tried first.
    However, discussing this with a doctor first is necessary. Setting goals for yourself, joining a support group, finding healthy outlets to channel your energy such as exercizing or other hobbies on campus, and
    learning relaxation techniques such as meditation, deep breathing or muscle relaxation can help as well. In addition, there are multiple online resources that help with helping one understand OCD and treating
    OCD: IOCDF (the International OCD Foundation), Peace of Mind Foundation, BeyondOCD and more.</p>

  <button class="accordion"><h2>Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)</h2></button>
  <div class = "panel">
  <div class = "box">
    <div class= "disorderhead">
      <p> PTSD is a disorder that develops in people that have had a shocking, scary, dangerous or traumatic event. This can be through nightmares or flashbacks.
    There can be certain situations or things people see that can trigger this. People that go through traumatic events have difficulty moving past the event
    or coping with it. With time and self care, however, this can improve. Up to 17% of college students suffer from PTSD.</p>
      <h2>Symptoms</h2>
      <p>Flashbacks, Loneliness, Agressive Outbursts, Nightmares, Guilt, Insomnia, Social isolation, Self destructive behavior, Avoiding people/places that remind
      one of the traumatic event, Negative thoughts, Hopelessness, Difficulty maintaining relationships, Lack of interest in activities, Being easily frightened
      or startled, Trouble concentrating, Depression, Anxiety and fear.</p>
    </div>
      <img src="images/ptsd.png" alt = "PTSD" class="image"/>
  </div>
  <h2>What you should do if you notice signs of PTSD in you or a friend</h2>
  <p>With PTSD, it is very difficult for one to cope with the trauma they have experienced. A treatment technique that is proven effective is Trauma Focused Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy. This is talking to
    a counselor or mental health professional about the scarring experience they went through, difficult emotions that have occured since the event and how they are coping with those emotions. It focuses on
    decreasing the stress, anxiety and feelings about the incident and how to cope with the symptoms. Another treatment is Prolonged Exposure Therapy. This is having the individual talk or relive the event
    over and over again or going to the place where the event took place or places that remind them of the event, deliberately "triggering" the individual. Doing this over time can allow the person to get
    less anxious and triggered by the event and no longer suffer the PTSD symptoms. Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EDMR) is another treatment process that combines Exposure Therapy with
    guided eye movements that can help you process traumatic memories and change how you react to them. Being able to recognize what the triggers are for you or your friend is really important for you or your friend to
    cope with PTSD. On college campuses in particular can bring challenges to people who thought they have coped with their PTSD such as alcohol/drugs, crowded classrooms, noises, lack of sleep and the stress from school
    assignments. If you have a friend going through PTSD, understanding the situation they went through, being patient, offering to go with them to get help, being encouraging, and being there to listen is the best way to help them.
    Using relaxation techniques such as deep breathing, meditation and thought journaling, avoiding caffeine and alcohol, and having hobbies/activities as an outlet will help as well.</p>

  <button class="accordion"><h2>Suicide</h2></button>
  <div class = "panel">
  <div class = "box">
    <div class= "disorderhead">

    to improve their mental health, it can lead to this. However, it affects all their loved ones, not just the victim. In 2018, 1 in 5 college students were so stressed they considered
    suicide as an option for themself. In 2013, suicide was the 2nd leading cause of death for college students in the United States.</p>

  <p>Anorexia Nervosa is an eating disorder characterized by weight loss because they purposely limit the the amount of calories they consume and types of foods they eat.
     It is difficult to maintain the right weight for height, age and stature which can lead to distorted body image. Some people also exercise compulsively or purge
     through vomiting and laxatives.</p>
  <h3>Bulimia Nervosa Disorder</h3>
  <p>Bulimia Nervosa is a life threatening disorder where one binges on food and then compensates for that by forcing themself to vomit to undo how much they ate. </p>
  <h3>Binge Eating Disorder</h3>

  <h2>What you should do if you notice signs of Eating Disorders in you or a friend</h2>
  <p>Understanding the reality of having an eating disorder is very important. If you notice signs in a friend, talk to them and share your concerns. Help them understand that not eating
    will not help their vanity, it is a sickness that threatens their health. Listen but do not let them convince you they are okay when they are not. Be an example, come up with weight
    loss/gain goals together. Understand why they binge eat or do not eat, what their concerns are with their body. Let them know that help is available on and off campus. If you or
    your friend is exhibiting signs, get yourself or your friend to an eating disorder professional. Talking to a professional will give them the psychological and nutritional
    counseling they need as well as therapies and treatments. Nutritional counseling involves educating one about nutritional needs. Coping strategies in the moment are thought journaling,
    being mindful and aware of your senses, being active to channel your energy, listening to music, etc. There are many good online resources that help with eating disorders as well.

  <button class="accordion"><h2>Addiction</h2></button>
  <div class = "panel">
  <div class = "box">
    <div class= "disorderhead">
      <p>Addiction is defined as dependency and repeated abuse of a drug or substance. In college, alcohol and drugs commonly can turn into an addiction. It is a psychological and physical
    innability to stop consuming a substance or drug even though it is damaging themself. About 21.3% of young adults use illicit drugs, and about 20% meet the Alcohol Use Disorder criteria.</p>

    suspicious behaviors, change your physical appearance.</p>
  <h2>What you should do if you notice signs of Addiction in you or a friend</h2>
  <p>If someone resorts to alcohol when encountering a bad situation, finding new outlets to cope with their anger/pain is very important. Relaxation is essential to recovery. This includes meditation, exercise, spending time with family and friends,
    working, finding new hobbies, going for a walk, and listening to music are all healthier ways to cope with a problem rather than drinking. For people struggling with addiction, avoid high risk situations where alcohol/drugs
    are present so you are not as tempted. Surround yourself with people that are a positive influence, will not cause you to feel tense, angry or lonely and will help you stop the drinking/drugs. Being honest about where
    you are getting the alcohol/drugs from and sticking with not using them is essential to avoid a relapse. Finally, seeking help from a professional will help you achieve sobriety so they can help identify what influenced
    you to develop addiction and provide helpful therapies or support groups to deal with the stressors and triggers.</p>
